## 🦇 About the Project
**Netflux** is a lightweight Android application designed to help users take control of their financial flow. In an era dominated by subscription models (Netflix, Spotify, etc.), keeping track of monthly expenses can be overwhelming. 

I developed this project as my first step into the **Kotlin** ecosystem, focusing on mastering modern Android development tools and state management.

## Key Features
* **Expense Tracking:** Easily add and categorize your subscriptions and daily expenses.
* **Flexible Frequency:** Define payment cycles (Monthly, Yearly, etc.) to understand your long-term spending.
* **Modern UI/UX:** Built entirely with **Jetpack Compose** for a smooth and declarative user experience.
* **State Management:** Implemented **ViewModel** and **State** handling to ensure a clean separation of concerns (MVVM).

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **Language:** [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/)
* **UI:** [Jetpack Compose](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose)
* **Architecture:** MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)
